ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* LICENSE
* README.markdown
* ant.properties
* build.xml
* demo\
* demo\.classpath
* demo\.project
* demo\AndroidManifest.xml
* demo\ant.properties
* demo\build.xml
* demo\proguard.cfg
* demo\project.properties
* demo\res\
* demo\res\layout\
* demo\res\layout\main.xml
* demo\res\values\
* demo\res\values\strings.xml
* demo\src\
* demo\src\com\
* demo\src\com\commonsware\
* demo\src\com\commonsware\cwac\
* demo\src\com\commonsware\cwac\locpoll\
* demo\src\com\commonsware\cwac\locpoll\demo\
* demo\src\com\commonsware\cwac\locpoll\demo\LocationPollerDemo.java
* demo\src\com\commonsware\cwac\locpoll\demo\LocationReceiver.java
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => locationPoller\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* res\ => locationPoller\src\main\res\
* src\ => locationPoller\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
